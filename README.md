## Overview

Multihead Attention (MHA) is a critical component in many modern machine learning models, especially in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision tasks. This repository provides several variations of MHA blocks that can be integrated into your projects.

## Features

- **Custom Implementations**: Various types of MHA blocks tailored for specific use cases.
- **Flexibility**: Designed to be easily integrated into your machine learning pipelines.
- **Efficiency**: Focus on computational efficiency and scalability.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sine2pi/MHA.git
```

Ensure you have Python installed. Create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: If there's no `requirements.txt` file, specify the libraries used in the project, such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.

## Usage

Import the required modules from the repository into your project. For example:

```python
from multiheads import MultiHeadAttention

# Example usage
mha = MultiHeadAttention(embed_dim=256, num_heads=8)
output = mha(input_tensor)
```

Replace this example with the actual usage instructions specific to your implementation.

## Examples

You can find examples and test scripts in the repository to help you get started. Check the `examples/` directory (if applicable) for detailed use cases.
